# Coding Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges. The solutions are organized by programming language.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
.
└── solutions
    ├── <language>
    │   ├── <challenge_name>
    │   │   └── ...
    ...
```

Each language has its own directory under `solutions`, and within each language directory, there are subdirectories for each coding challenge.

## Usage

To view a solution, navigate to the corresponding language and challenge directory. For example, to find the "hello-world" solution in Rust, you would go to `solutions/rust/hello-world`.
